            <p>Companies and their structures are always evolving. 
            Regardless of the reason, with people and information exchanging places, 
            it’s easy for maintainership/ownership information about a repository to become outdated or unclear.
             Maintainers play a crucial role in guiding and stewarding a project, and knowing who they are is 
             essential for efficient collaboration and decision-making. This information can be stored in 
             the CODEOWNERS file but how can we ensure that it’s up to date? Let’s delve into why this matters 
             and how the GitHub OSPO’s tool, cleanowners, can help maintainers achieve accurate ownership 
             information for their projects.</p>
             <p>In any software project, having clear ownership guidelines is crucial 
              for effective collaboration. Maintainers are responsible for reviewing 
              contributions, merging changes, and guiding the project’s direction. 
              Without clear ownership information, contributors may be unsure of who to 
              reach out to for guidance or review. Imagine that you’ve discovered a high-risk 
              security vulnerability and nobody is responding to your pull request to fix it, 
              let alone coordinating that everyone across the company gets the patches needed for fixing it. 
              This ambiguity can lead to delays and confusion, unfortunately teaching teams that it’s 
              better to maintain control than to collaborate. These are not the outcomes we are hoping for 
              as developers, so it’s important for us to consider how we can ensure active maintainership 
              especially of our production components.</p>
